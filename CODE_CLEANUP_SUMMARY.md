### 🔄 Component Breakdown Completed

#### 1. **Type Definitions (`types/`)**
- ✅ `interfaces.ts` - All TypeScript interfaces extracted and organized
- ✅ `constants.ts` - Contract types, networks, and utility functions

#### 2. **Form Components (`forms/`)**
- ✅ `BasicSettingsForm.tsx` - Token name, symbol, supply, decimals, network
- ✅ `ContractTypeSelector.tsx` - 8 contract types with complexity levels
- ✅ `SecurityFeaturesForm.tsx` - Security features grouped by category
- ✅ `TaxSettingsForm.tsx` - Tax rates, distribution, quick presets
- ✅ `WalletSettingsForm.tsx` - Wallet addresses with validation

#### 3. **Section Components (`sections/`)**
- ✅ `CodePreviewSection.tsx` - Code preview, validation, download, copy

#### 4. **Utilities (`utils/`)**
- ✅ `contractGenerator.ts` - Smart contract code generation and deployment instructions

#### 5. **Main Component**

## ✨ Summary

The ContractCodeGenerator has been successfully refactored from a monolithic 863-line component into a well-organized, modular architecture with 13 focused components. This cleanup significantly improves maintainability, developer experience, and user experience while preserving all existing functionality and adding new features.

The new structure makes it easy to add new contract types, form sections, and features without affecting existing code, setting a solid foundation for future development.
